# Line-Control-App
This is a basic phone app I made to practice C# .net and study Xamarin. 
The app itself I made to help track the number of people coming in and out of work during the Covid 19 lockdown.
You can set a limit of how many people you want, a minimum number of people and a targit. 
As the number of people in the store get higher its colour will change when it hits the set values.
